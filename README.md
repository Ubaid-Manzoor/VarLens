# 📚 **VarLens – Visualize and Inspect Your Variables with Precision**

**VarLens** is an innovative Visual Studio Code extension designed to revolutionize how developers interact with variables during coding and debugging. It provides an intuitive and seamless way to inspect & visualize variable states directly in the editor — even across sessions.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

- 🔍 **Real-Time Variable Inspection:** Instantly view variable values on hover, no `console.log` needed.
- 💾 **Persistent Variable State:** Remembers variable values across debugging sessions — view past states without rerunning the code.
- 🛑 **Breakpoint Snapshots:** Captures variable states at breakpoints for later inspection.
