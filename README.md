## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. **Hover Over Variables:** View real-time values or cached values from previous sessions.  
2. **Persistent State:** If a variable was logged in a past session, its value remains available on hover.  
3. **Breakpoint Memory:** If you added a breakpoint, VarLens remembers the state of variables at that exact moment.
