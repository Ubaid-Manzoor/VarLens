## 🧠 **How It Works**

1. **Breakpoint Memory:** After Starting the Debug session, you will add breakpoint in the block which you want to remember the variable of.
2. **Cache Data on End Sesso** After you are done with the session just stop the session and your variables will be saved.
3. **Hover Over Variables:** Now on Hover you will see the value of the variable.
4. **Inspect Variable** For Large you can simple click on inspect variable on Hover, and you will see proper view of the variable.
